## The Beginning

I started my journey in graphic design when I was 14 years old. What began as a hobby quickly turned into a passion that would shape my career path.

## Learning the Tools

The first tool I learned was Adobe Photoshop. I spent countless hours watching tutorials and experimenting with different techniques. Eventually, I moved on to:

- **Adobe Illustrator** - For vector graphics and logo design
- **Adobe InDesign** - For layout and publication design
- **Figma** - For UI/UX design

## Key Lessons Learned

Throughout my journey, I've learned several important lessons:

1. **Simplicity is key** - The best designs are often the simplest ones
2. **Typography matters** - Good typography can make or break a design
3. **Never stop learning** - The design industry is always evolving
4. **Feedback is valuable** - Constructive criticism helps you grow

## My Design Philosophy

> "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." - Steve Jobs

This quote has always resonated with me. I believe that good design should not only be visually appealing but also functional and user-friendly.

## What's Next

I'm currently focused on improving my UI/UX skills and learning more about web development. The intersection of design and code is where I want to be.

Thanks for reading!
