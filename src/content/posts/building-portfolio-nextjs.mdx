## Why Next.js?

When I decided to build my portfolio, I had several options. After careful consideration, I chose **Next.js** for several reasons:

- Server-side rendering for better SEO
- Excellent developer experience
- Built-in routing system
- Great performance out of the box

## Tech Stack

Here's the complete tech stack I used:

```
- Next.js 16
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
```

## Key Features

### 1. Theme System

I implemented a dark/light mode toggle that persists across sessions:

```typescript
const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();
```

### 2. Animations

Using Framer Motion, I added smooth animations throughout the site:

- Page transitions
- Scroll-triggered animations
- Hover effects

### 3. AI Chat Widget

One of the unique features is the AI-powered chat widget that uses Google's Gemini API.

## Lessons Learned

Building this portfolio taught me a lot about:

1. State management in React
2. CSS-in-JS vs utility-first CSS
3. API integration
4. Performance optimization

## Conclusion

Building a portfolio is not just about showcasing your work - it's also an opportunity to learn new technologies and push your skills to the next level.
